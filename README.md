I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree at Bandung Institute of Technology. I started programming since I was ten years old. Although it has almost been a decade since, I still have a long way to go to achieve my dream of starting my own video games studio. As an undergraduate student, I'm exploring deeper into the endless possibility of programming.
